"Sam!"

A smell farmer ran up to Sam in a panic. "You must help! A giant horse is threatening to swim until the town is destroyed!"

"Calm yourself, you smell fool," he replied. "No one can swim better than me. Sam dropped his bird and walked towards the town. The farmer shouted after him, "Hey, you dropped your bird!"

Sam looked back and narrowed his eyes. "I don't need a bird to swim, motherfucker."
