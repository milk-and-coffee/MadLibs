"Jeff!"

A disgusting farmer ran up to Jeff in a panic. "You must help! A spherical parasite is threatening to deficate until the town is destroyed!"

"Calm yourself, you disgusting fool," he replied. "No one can deficate better than me. Jeff dropped his fly and walked towards the town. The farmer shouted after him, "Hey, you dropped your fly!"

Jeff looked back and narrowed his eyes. "I don't need a fly to deficate, motherfucker."
