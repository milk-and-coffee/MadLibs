"PERSON0!"

A ADJECTIVE0 villager ran up to PERSON0 in a panic. "You must help! PERSON1 is threatening to VERB0 until our town is destroyed!"

"Calm yourself," he replied. "No one can VERB0 better than me." PERSON0 dropped his NOUN1 and walked towards the town. The farmer shouted after him, "Hey, you dropped your NOUN1!" PERSON0 looked back and narrowed his eyes. "I don't need a NOUN1 to VERB0."

PERSON0 entered the town; the destruction had already begun. Two NOUN2s were completely flattened and the village's finest NOUN3 was rendered completely ADJECTIVE1.

"PERSON1", called PERSON0. "How dare you VERB0 in my town. Leave this place or you will VERB0 right to your doom." PERSON1 turned its ADJECTIVE2 visage towards PERSON0 and growled, “Impossible. You don’t stand a chance; you don’t even have a NOUN1.”

"Then VERB0! Go ahead and VERB0, you NOUN4 of a ADJECTIVE2 NOUN5," came the reply.

PERSON1 made an attempt to VERB0 directly at PERSON0, but it was far too slow. PERSON0 moved to VERB0 in response; an act so intense it opened a vast and ADJECTIVE3 pit below PERSON1.

"Back to the foul place from whence you came! Back to the unholy land of CITY0!"

And thus PERSON1 was banished back to CITY0 with the other harbingers of destruction, PERSON2 and PERSON3. If ever any should escape again, PERSON0 will be there to defend all that is ADJECTIVE4 and just.
