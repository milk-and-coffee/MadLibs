THE STORE

Working in a specialty NOUN0 store can get a little crazy.

Just last week, I was with a customer selling a ADJECTIVE0 NOUN1 which, contrary to popular belief, is actually classified as a kind of NOUN0. Anyway, I was demonstrating to the customer what kind of form he should have if he intended to VERB0 with the NOUN1 (safety first, of course) when one of the most ADJECTIVE1 customers I’d ever seen began shouting at me.

“Hey, this NOUN0 is defective! What kind of scam is this?!”

“Excuse me,” I replied, “I’m just finishing up with this customer. Now if you’ll step back a little bit; I don’t want to hit you when I VERB0.”

“You can VERB0 all you want, but I can’t believe you sell this junk!” With that, the customer threw the NOUN0 so hard it lodged in a nearby NOUN2 (we carry a few of these for enthusiasts). I dislodged the NOUN0. “It looks a little ADJECTIVE2,” I said. “Are you sure you didn’t try to VERB1 with it?”

The irate customer got so close to me I could smell his breath which reaked of old NOUN3s. “How dare you even imply such a thing?! Do you know who I am?! I’m PERSON0. I could pull a few strings and you’d be lucky to find a job in CITY0.”

“PERSON0? I thought you were dead,” interjected the other customer. PERSON0’s face turned a ADJECTIVE3 shade of purple, and they stormed out of the store.

The first customer smiled and shrugged. In the end, they ended up buying both the original NOUN1 as well as the NOUN0 that PERSON0 had thrown.

That customer’s name? PERSON1.
